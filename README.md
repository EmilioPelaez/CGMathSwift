## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Description

CGMathSwift is a collection of extensions for CoreGraphics data types to help you perform calculations with them.

For `CGFloat`, `Float` and `Double` types, it includes functions like lerp, inverse lerp, clamp and remap.

It also adds basic math operations (+, -, *, /) to `CGPoint`, as well as lerp and other useful properties and initializers to `CGPoint`, `CGSize` and `CGRect`.

These extensions are designed to make developing animations easier.

## Installation

CGMathSwift is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "CGMathSwift"
```
